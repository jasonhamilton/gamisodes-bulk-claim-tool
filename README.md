# What is this?

The bulk claiming tool is a Chrome extension that allows Gamisodes NFT holders to bulk transfer their assets to their Dapper wallet in bulk (vs clicking one at a time).  The tool adds a "Claim All" button to the Gamisodes NFT viewer to allow for an easy way to get all of your assets into your wallet(see screenshot).
